Purpose:
This file contains the declaration for a calendar component. The main purpose of CalendarComponent is to add date/time information to
the DisplayableComponent class. All components in the Calendar will derive publicly from this class. The date/time infor is stored as a variable of type
struct tm. Please see the layout of the tm struct below. This class also declares some useful constants for the Calendar

/* 
here is the layout of the tm struct, it is declared in <ctime> header file

struct tm {
	int tm_sec;   // seconds of minutes from 0 to 61
	int tm_min;   // minutes of hour from 0 to 59
	int tm_hour;  // hours of day from 0 to 24
	int tm_mday;  // day of month from 1 to 31
	int tm_mon;   // month of year from 0 to 11
	int tm_year;  // year since 1900
	int tm_wday;  // days since sunday
	int tm_yday;  // days since January 1st
	int tm_isdst; // hours of daylight savings time
